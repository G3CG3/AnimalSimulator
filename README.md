# AnimalSimulator

A simple Java console application demonstrating **inheritance** and **polymorphism**.

## Overview

This project defines an abstract `Animal` class with basic behaviors, and three concrete subclasses:

- `Dog`
- `Cat`
- `Bird`

Each subclass provides its own implementation of the behaviors:
- `makeSound()`
- `move()`
- `eat()`

The `AnimalSimulator` main class creates instances of each animal and calls their methods, demonstrating polymorphism.

## How to Run

1. Compile the project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ).
2. Run the `AnimalSimulator` class.
3. Observe the console output showing different behaviors for each animal.

## Sample Output

---

Animal: Rex is a Dog
Rex says: Woof!
Rex runs around happily.
Rex eats dog food.

---

Animal: Whiskers is a Cat
Whiskers says: Meow!
Whiskers stalks silently.
Whiskers eats cat food.

---

Animal: Tweety is a Bird
Tweety says: Tweet!
Tweety flies in the sky.
Tweety pecks at seeds.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Abstract classes
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation (basic)
